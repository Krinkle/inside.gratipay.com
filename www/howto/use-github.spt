## Pull Requests

Think of PRs as being owned by the Gratipay team as a whole. Anyone can add
comments or commits to a PR at any time, and when two or more agree that it's
ready, then it's ready. The only rule of thumb is that the last person to
commit should not merge (we do break this rule occasionally, usually because we
don't have enough reviewers and we need to keep shipping).

Basically anyone who wants to care about a given PR is
responsible to get in there and be part of the conversation and development. We
need at least two people, but if a third sticks their head in then the PR now
has three people who need to agree by consensus before someone besides the last
committer merges.

Unfortunately, GitHub's review workflow encourages a rather individualistic and
bureaucratic relation, where a PR is owned by a single person, who has to seek
formal approval from othersâ€”but that's not how we operate. Therefore, think of
review requests as invitations and not requirements.
