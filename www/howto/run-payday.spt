Here's how to run payday. Gratipay Bot
[should](https://github.com/gratipay/bot#what-does-gratipay-bot-do) start a new
payday ticket each Thursday morning. After each step, record the result on
Gratipay Bot's ticket.

  1. [Review accounts](./review-accounts).
  1. Take a backup using `bin/snapper.py`. Load the backup locally and make
     sure the homepage matches the production homepage.
  1. Check Gratipay Bot's ticket to get the payday number, `NNN`, from the
     title.
  1. On latest master: `./payday.sh NNN for_real_please`. Answer yes at the
     prompts. It wants to log into a `../logs/payday/` directory.
  1. `Ctrl-C` if you want to stop tailing the logfile (the `payday.sh` script
     uses `disown` to detach itself from the controlling terminal&mdash;if you
want to kill the script you have to
[scramble](https://github.com/gratipay/inside.gratipay.com/issues/1149#issuecomment-326527847)
to `ps` and then `kill` it &#x1F615; ).
  1. Wait a minute or two.
  1. If `payday.sh` fails, fix it, documenting everything on Gratipay Bot's
     ticket.
  1. [Run MassPay](run-masspay).
  1. [Shuffle escrow](shuffle-escrow).
  1. Commit the logs from payday and masspay to git and push them up to the
     `logs` repo.
  1. Review the card decline rate in the Braintree
     [dashboard](https://www.braintreegateway.com/).  If it's 15% or greater,
find a reason and report it to riskteam at getbraintree com.
  1. Review and edit these documents.
  1. Close Gratipay Bot's ticket.
  1. If it's the last payday of the month, update the rotation in the ticket
     description: copy/paste the current airplane row to the bottom of the
table, then move the airplane back up!

## Notes

  - When a supporter's credit card fails, the tips from that user are
    *excluded* from the total receiving amounts of those they gift, so as not
to mislead the receiver about likely future earning.
  - When a supporter's card fails, we notify them once and they have to fix it
    before we start charging them again. Gifts accumulate for one week, so if a
card fails and they fix it inside of the week, we double-charge the next week.
But if they go four months before fixing then we still only double-charge.
