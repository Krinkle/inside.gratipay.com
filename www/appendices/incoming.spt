When [reviewing projects](/howto/review-projects), we ask everyone how they found us. Here is a list of responses.

- > I've seen a badge or mention of gratpay on some opesource project while studying the sourcecode. Then I realize that I could raise some money through it, to for example buy a ramda-adjunct.com domain and so on... https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/553#issuecomment-324536389
- > I've heard about gratipay a long before but now decided to try this method. https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/439#issuecomment-305864992
- > I saw on github badges. https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/442#issuecomment-306416852
- > i heard about gratipay from internet.. https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/446#issuecomment-306880316
- > I came across a tweet/retweet of Dhaval Kapil's (@DhavalKapil) HeapExploition gitbook (https://gratipay.com/~DhavalKapil/) - https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com. I hadn't heard about either gratipay or gitbook before that, but thought both projects and Dhaval's book were very cool. https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/447#issuecomment-306872473
- > I had heard of Gratipay through https://shields.io as I saw it in the badge list, and thus started reading up on it :3 https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/448#issuecomment-306976233
- > I was a Gratipay user in 2015, so this is more a "Welcome back" instead ;-) https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/450#issuecomment-307816680
- > A friend on Facebook suggested it. So I am giving it a try https://github.com/gratipay/project-review/issues/452#issuecomment-307822702
