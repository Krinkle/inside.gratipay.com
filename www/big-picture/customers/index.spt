Our [mission](../mission) is to cultivate an economy of gratitude, generosity,
and love, and our core [values](../brand/) are safety, consent, transparency,
openness, and love. We define love as "freely serving one another." Whom do we
see ourselves as freely serving? Who, in other words, are our customers?
