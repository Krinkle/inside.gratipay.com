Welcome to Gratipay! We are an [open organization](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-organization),
with a porous boundary between our *users* and our *staff*. The purpose of this
website is to document Gratipay's business processes for our staff, and the
purpose of this document is to help you take your first steps to becoming a
Gratipay staff member.


## Four Roles

We think of people in relation to Gratipay in four roles:

  - **users**&mdash;people with an account on Gratipay
  - **contributors**&mdash;people conversing in [our space](/appendices/channels)
  - **owners**&mdash;users who buy into [our mission](./mission)
  - **staff**&mdash;owners who ~~are~~ *will be* on [our
    payroll](https://gratipay.com/Gratipay/distributing/)

<img src="roles.jpg" width="100%">

Each role is open to anyone willing and able to fill it, and each carries
certain responsibilities and expectations.

To be a **user**, [create an account](https://gratipay.com/)! We'll expect
you to abide by our [terms and
        conditions](https://gratipay.com/about/terms/).

To be a **contributor**, simply [enter our space](/appendices/channels) and
join the conversation! We'll expect you to [behave well](/howto/behave-well).

To be an **owner**, simply think of yourself as an owner! We'll expect you to
identify with and pursue [our mission](./mission) (we're [working on
bylaws](https://github.com/gratipay/inside.gratipay.com/issues/72) to formalize
what it means to be an owner).

To join our **staff**, start doing work! We'll expect you to be comfortable
with our [team takes](https://gratipay.com/about/features/payroll)
system&mdash;once we bring that back. :-(


## Onboarding as a Staff Member

**First**, read through the rest of our [big picture](/big-picture/) documents.
They provide important context about the nature of our company and what we are
trying to accomplish.

**Second**, make sure you're aware of our [behavior
standards](/howto/behave-well) for contributors, and our processes for [dealing
with bad behavior](/howto/deal-with-bad-behavior).

**Third**, skim through the [howtos](/howto/) on this site as well as the
[appendices](/appendices/), so you can start to become familiar with what
documentation exists for when you run into questions.

**Fourth** is to jump in! Our main communication channel is GitHub, so if you
don't have a GitHub account, [create
one](https://github.com/join?source=gratipay-onboarding). Then [make a
ticket](https://github.com/gratipay/inside.gratipay.com/issues/new#title=onboard+@me)
titled "onboard @me" (your GitHub username), and introduce yourself and what
you're interested in working on. Your onboarding ticket will be your place to
ask any and all questions you have as you orient yourself as a Gratipay staff
member.

After you make your onboarding ticket, someone from Gratipay will respond and
you will be off and running! Welcome aboard! :-)
