Our [organization](org-chart) delivers a [product](https://gratipay.com/) to
help companies and others pay for open source. Below are the projects we've got
going on right now. Links are to GitHub projects, milestones, and issues. Dive
in! &#x1f483;

_**Note:** Unfortunately, GitHub projects require repo access even to view.
It's a new feature so hopefully GitHub will make them publishable soon.  [Tell
them to](mailto:support@github.com), and then ping us on
[Slack](/appendices/chat) or your [onboarding ticket](/big-picture/welcome) for
access. Sorry!_ &#x1F61E;
