The problem we're trying to solve is funding open culture. There are these new
kinds of organizations that give value away freely, creating a "value vacuum,"
pressure to compensate them for the value after the fact rather than
beforehand. Here are some illustrative buckets:

1. open source software projects
1. consumer-grade projects like Wikipedia, Mozilla, and the Internet Archive
1. digital content creators
1. community-oriented coworking and hacker spaces

In economic terms, these groups are providing *non-excludable* goods,
specifically *common-pool resources* (if *rivalrous*, like coworking space), or
*public goods* (if *non-rivalrous*, like software and other digital content).
Here's the
[matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#Definition_matrix):

![goods matrix](matrix.png)

There are three ways to make public goods economically sustainable:

1. **Enclosure**. In other words, taking goods out of the commons, making them
   excludable. Booooorrriiinnngg!

1. **Taxation**. This is akin to enclosure, in that both involve *forcing* people
   to pay for the thing.

1. **Social norms**. At its worst, this looks like guilt-tripping and shaming.
   At its best, it looks like inviting people to be grateful and generous and
Do the Right Thing&trade;. This is us! &#x1f483; 

If we pull this off then we may very well
[create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWH3Waigi5Y#t=5h59m17s) a new
[sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sector#By_ownership) of the
economy: public, private, voluntary, ... and open! And if we do that, hopefully
we'll have increased the gratitude and generosity in the world by a fraction of
a degree&mdash;maybe enough to get some interesting feedback loops going!
